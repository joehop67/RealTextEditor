# Unsoft Editor

#### Introduction
Hi there! I'm not quite sure how you might have stumbled upon this project, but welcome! My name is Joe. You don't know me, I guarantee it. Well, almost. I don't usually do the whole open-source thing because, well, I'm rather insecure about my code! But I've turned a new leaf. Anyway, enough about myself here's the project:

> # RealTextEditor!
What is it? Well, it's exactly what it says it is. It's a text editor, that's definitely real. Okay, it's more than that. Even in it's very limited state it's a fair bit more advanced than the Notepad clone I had started out with. It's an IDE that is, currently (subject to change at any given point) used for working with Java programs. Basically, it's a way to kill time while I try to find a job. I called it Unsoft because I'm writing software while *UN*employed. Original, eh?

#### Current Features:
 > -Basic input and output of files (obviously)
 -Syntax highlighting
 -Basic Java compilation
 -Ability to set project directory
 
#### TODO:
 > -Add in functioning terminal (My white whale)
 -Write tests (not my thing, maybe later)
 -Integrate Java build tools
 -Ability to create projects
 -Autocomplete and dynamic type and syntax checking
 -Output console
 -Debugger
 
 
 As you can see, there is still a lot I want to do with this because I think it's cool, I'm doig really interesting work, and it's a good way to kill boredom while I search for a job.
 
 If you (for whatever reason) want to help out then yeah, absolutely feel free. Personally, for now at least, I'd prefer it if you worked on your own separate branch just for now while I add stuff myself. If you have any interest, feel free to grab an item that needs to be completed on that TODO and get to work!
